R and NetCDF help - share your experiences here

Got a question? [Create a new issue](https://github.com/mdsumner/ranch/issues/new)

This repository is very new, over time we will try to collect shared knowledge for the R community. 

NetCDF is an incredibly general format, so there is no "one size fits all" solution. The traditional API is straightforward and systematic, but very low-level and unlikely to be any R user's first experience with the format. 

# Packages for NetCDF in R


* **ncdf4** - [traditional API ](https://github.com/mdsumner/ranch/wiki/Using-the-traditional-NetCDF-API)
* **raster** - [raster package](https://github.com/mdsumner/ranch/wiki/Using-the-raster-package-for-NetCDF)
* **rgdal** - . . . but not on Windows, unless you a ninja
